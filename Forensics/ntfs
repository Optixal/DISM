NTFS - Finding Data of a File

MFT - Master File Table to store files < 512 bytes in size (resident files) and to store records of file pointers that are > 512 bytes in size (non-resident files)

Start Sector - n sectors
Partition - Sector n

1.  Find MFT cluster location (offset 30 and 31 of volume partition of NTFS drive)
2.  Convert MFT cluster location to sectors (depending on sectors per cluster) + Start Sector Sectors to find MFT from start partition
3.  Search for file name: Unicode not ASCII (One character 16 bits instead of 8 bits: "H.e.l.l.o...W.o.r.l.d."
4.  Check whether the file is a valid MFT record (starts with "FILE0") 
5.  Offset 0x38 from "FILE0" to reach the first MFT attribute (where the hex value should be 0x10)
6.  Offset 4 bytes from the attribute and take the hex value, traverse downwards that amount of bytes (in hex) from the attribute
7.  Repeat the 6th step with the new location until value 0x80 (data attribute) is reached
8.  Offset 8 bytes from 0x80 to check whether it is resident or non-resident file (0x00 - resident, 0x01 - non-resident)
9a. If resident file, offset 0x18 (24 bytes) from 0x80, actual file data of resident file starts here
9b. If non-resident file, offset 0x40 (64 bytes) from 0x80, data run of non-resident file starts here

Data Run (3 components) (May vary in size, determine with first component) (Little Endian):
[32] [B1 07] [8C 8C 00]
1st component: Size of 2nd (2 bytes) and 3rd components (3 bytes) - Hence [32] (little endian) (eg. [52] -> 2 bytes for 2nd component, 5 bytes for 3rd component)
2nd component: Size of the data at 3rd pointer in clusters - [B1 07] -> [07 B1] -> 1969 clusters in this data run
3rd component: Pointer to the location of the data - [8C 8C 00] -> [00 8C 8C] -> 35980 clusters -> 287840 sectors + Start Sector Sectors -> 287871 sectors from start of disk
