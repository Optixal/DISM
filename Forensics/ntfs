NTFS - Finding Data of a File

Find MFT location
Search for file name: UTF-8 not ASCII (One character 16 bits instead of 8 bits: "H.e.l.l.o...W.o.r.l.d."
Check whether the file is a valid MFT record (starts with "FILE0") 
Offset 38 bytes from "FILE0" to reach the first MFT attribute (where the hex value should be 0x10)
Offset 4 bytes away from the attribute and take the hex value, traverse downwards that amount of bytes from the attribute
Repeat the above step with the new location until hex 0x80 (data attribute) is reached
Offset 18 bytes from 0x80, data starts there
