===========================
FAT12/16 and FAT32 (Little Endian) (focus on FAT16)

Root Sector (Start Sector 63)
Sector Size: 1

Reserved Area (Start Sector 64)
Sector Size: Size of Reserved Area [b14-15]

FAT
Sector Size: Number of FATs [b16] * Size of each FAT [b22-23]

Root Directory
Sector Size: Maximum Number of Files [b17-18] * 32 bytes / Bytes Per Sector [b11-12]

Data
Measured in clusters
FIRST CLUSTER OF DATA BLOCK IS 2

FAT example:
    2 - 3
    3 - 4
    4 - 0xFFF (Terminator)
    5 - 0 (Available, Deleted)
Note: When deleting a file, marks 0 from terminator backwards (recursion)

Root Directory example (offsets are from first character of filename):
    - [0x00 - 0x07] File Name: hello-world.txt
    - [0x16 - 0x17] Time updated: After little endianing, convert to bits, hhhhhmmmmmmsssss (where s is in two-second periods)
    - [0x18 - 0x19] Date updated: After little endianing, convert to bits, yyyyyyymmmmddddd (where year offsets from 1980)
    - [0x1a - 0x1b] Starting cluster: 4 (in the data block)
    - [0x1c - 0x1f] File Size: 92 bytes
Note: To mark file as available (deleting), start of file name modified to 0xE5
Note: To mark file as unallocated, start of file name is 0x00

*** IMPORTANT ***
To find what sector hello-world.txt is located at:
Start of Data block + Sector Offset of File
= (Root Sector + Reserved Area Sectors + FAT + Root Dir) + ((Start Cluster - 2 * Sectors Per Cluster)
= (63 + Size of Reserved Area [b14-15] + (Number of FATs [b16] * Size of each FAT [b22-23]) + (Maximum Number of Files [b17-18] * 32 bytes / Bytes Per Sector [b11-12])) + ((Start Cluster - 2) * Sectors Per Cluster [b13])
